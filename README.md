# OS-Setup
This repository contains all the setup manual and scripts used for my regularly used workstation OS (Ubuntu). This is also an effort to maintain an automated script of my local environment.

### Run the script
make the script files executable by sudo user. then simply run the script.

```bash
chmod +x *.sh && ./start.sh
```
